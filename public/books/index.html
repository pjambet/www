	<h1>The list of (tech-ish) books I've read/started</h1>
	<h2>Read</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Seven Databases in Seven weeks
		</li>

		<li>
			Design Patterns in Ruby
		</li>

		<li>
			Radical Candor
		</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Started</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>JavaScript The Good Parts</p>
			<em>Why? Not sure, probably got bored, that was a while ago</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Programming Erlang</p>
			<em>Why? Distraction, I liked everything I read, even though the Erland syntax is really really not friendly IMO</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Elm in Action</p>
			<em>Why? One of the most recent books I received so I decided to not start it until I finish others (because it took a while between the EAP and the actual book showing up in my inbox, which had to re-routed after it shipped because it was sent to an old address).</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Elixir in Action</p>
			<em>Why? I think I had read another Elixir book (or online tutorial?) and it felt redundant, that being said I'm not an Elixir expert (far far from it)</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Functional Programming in Scala (aka, "The Red Book")</p>
			<em>Why? The last two chapters got really really hairy and lost me</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Pro Git</p>
			<em>Why? I think I got bored, felt like reading the phonebook</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Working Effectively With Legacy Code</p>
			<em>Why? "Started" is a bit of a stretch here, I read the first chapter. It looks great though.</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Refactoring</p>
			<em>Why? I don't think I have the book anymore, it's probably sitting at one of my old desks at a previous job</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>An Elegant Puzzle</p>
			<em>Why? Laziness, really. The book looks amazing though.</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook</p>
			<em>Why? I got this book when I was super excited about Elixir circa 2016, and I had a nice budget at work. I got about halfway, and loved it.</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Clojure For The Brave And True</p>
			<em>Why? Because I'm currently working through it, as of 02/21</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>The Rust Programming Language</p>
			<em>Why? Because I rarely finish what I start, and got distracted about a third in. One day I'll finish it, it's great</em>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Building Git</p>
			<em>About two thirds of the way through, it's one of the best books I've ever read, I'll finish it, but I'm slowing going through and making sure I actually write the code on my own</em>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Want to read/Should read</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Coming soon...
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Why?</h4>
	<p>
	It's not about bragging (I don't read that much, so I don't think it would be that effective), it's more about accountability and mindfulness. Maybe it'll help me move some of these to the "Read" section.
